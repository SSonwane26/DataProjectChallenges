# Onxy Data Project Challenge May2024
Story of my journey as Data Analyst, complete information of my Project and my Final Presentations.

Good Morning, I am Saurabh. Today, I'm here to provide detailed information about my journey, for this project, as a data analyst at Onxy Data Services.
### About Me
First, let me introduce myself. My name is Saurabh Sonwane, one years' experience with analytical tools. I hold a degree in mechanical engineering and have been working as a Graduate Engineer Trainee (GET) in a multinational corporation. During my tenure there, my curiosity was piqued by the world of data sciences and analytics. I embarked on a journey to learn various analysis techniques, specializing in data transformation and visualization, utilizing tools such as MS Excel and PowerBI. Additionally, I honed my programming skills in SQL and Python.

**Data Analysis and Exploration:**

1. Analyze the distribution of tickets across different statuses (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed) to understand the overall workflow and identify any bottlenecks.
2. Investigate which source channels (chat, phone, email) generate the most tickets, helping to optimize support resources and communication strategies.
3. Examine the distribution of ticket priorities (low, medium, high) to identify the urgency levels most frequently encountered and plan resource allocation accordingly.
4. Analyze the performance and workload of different support levels (Tier 1, Tier 2) to ensure that tickets are appropriately escalated and managed.
5. Evaluate the volume and types of tickets associated with different product groups to identify potential issues with specific products and guide product improvements.
6. Identify the most common topics of customer inquiries to understand recurring issues and areas where additional support resources or documentation may be needed.
7. Assess the performance of different agent groups (1st level support, 2nd level support) by measuring ticket resolution times and customer satisfaction ratings.
8. Analyze individual agent performance in terms of the number of tickets handled, average resolution time, and customer satisfaction scores to identify top performers and areas for improvement.
9. Investigate the average first response time and its compliance with the expected SLA to identify areas where the initial response can be improved.
10. Examine the average resolution time and its compliance with the expected SLA to ensure tickets are resolved efficiently and within expected timeframes.
11. Analyze customer satisfaction ratings to gauge the overall effectiveness of the support provided and identify areas where service quality can be enhanced.
12. Map the geographical distribution of tickets to understand where most customer inquiries originate and tailor support services to those regions.
13. Assess the total count of agent interactions per ticket to understand the complexity and effort required to resolve different types of tickets.
14. Examine trends in ticket creation, resolution, and closure over time to identify seasonal patterns or shifts in customer support demand.
15. Track SLA compliance trends for both first response and resolution over time to monitor improvements or declines in meeting service level agreements.
