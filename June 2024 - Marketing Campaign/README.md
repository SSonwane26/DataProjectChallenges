### About Me
First, let me introduce myself. My name is Saurabh Sonwane, having one years' experience with analytical tools. I hold a degree in mechanical engineering and have been working as a Graduate Engineer Trainee (GET) in a multinational corporation. During my tenure there, my curiosity was piqued by the world of data sciences and analytics. I embarked on a journey to learn various analysis techniques, specializing in data transformation and visualization, utilizing tools such as MS Excel and PowerBI. Additionally, I honed my programming skills in SQL and Python.

**Suggestions and Recommendations:**

Campaign Management:
- Focus on High-Performing Campaigns: Continue investing in the Fall campaign as it shows the highest metrics across clicks, impressions, conversions, and revenue. Apply successful strategies from the Fall campaign to other campaigns.
- Maximize Collection Ad Types: Given their high performance on both Facebook and Instagram in terms of clicks and impressions, prioritize collection ad types in future campaigns.

Geographical Targeting:
- Prioritize High-Performing Locations: Focus more on London and Birmingham for ad placements. Londonâ€™s high click-through rate and Birminghamâ€™s high conversion rate make these cities valuable targets.
- Adjust Strategies for Underperforming Locations: Analyze why certain locations might not be performing as well and adjust targeting or messaging accordingly.

Device Optimization:
- Enhance Desktop Campaigns: Since desktop devices show high conversion rates, especially in Birmingham, tailor ad creatives and bids to optimize for desktop users.
- Consider Mobile-First Approach Where Applicable: While desktop performs well, ensure mobile campaigns are not neglected given the increasing mobile usage.

Cost Efficiency:
- Monitor and Reduce High Costs: Continuously monitor campaigns to reduce high cost per click (CPC) and high cost per acquisition (CPA). Implement cost-saving strategies like better audience segmentation and bid adjustments.
- Focus on High ROAS Campaigns: Increase budget allocation to campaigns and ad types that have shown high ROAS, such as the Summer campaign and discount ad types.

Engagement and Ad Creatives:
- Boost Engagement on Instagram and Pinterest: Enhance engagement strategies on Instagram and Pinterest, where engagement rates are high. Use engaging creatives and interactive content to maintain and boost engagement levels.
- Utilize High-Engagement Ad Types: Increase the use of ad types that have higher engagement rates, such as discount ads on Instagram and collection ads on Pinterest.

Timing and Seasonality:
- Capitalize on Seasonal Trends: Given the high ROAS in the month of June for collection ad types and August for discount ad types, plan campaigns around these times to maximize impact.
- Adjust Bids During Peak Periods: Increase bids during months with historically high click-through rates, such as October, to capture more audience attention.

Continuous Improvement:
- Regular Performance Reviews: Conduct regular performance reviews to stay updated on campaign efficiency. Use these reviews to make data-driven adjustments to strategy.
- Experiment and Test: Implement A/B testing to continually refine and improve ad creatives, targeting, and overall campaign strategies based on what yields the best results.
