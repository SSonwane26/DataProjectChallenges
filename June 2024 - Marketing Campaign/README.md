Good Morning, I am Saurabh. Today, I'm here to provide detailed information about my journey, for this project, as a data analyst at Onxy Data Services.
### About Me
First, let me introduce myself. My name is Saurabh Sonwane, having one years' experience with analytical tools. I hold a degree in mechanical engineering and have been working as a Graduate Engineer Trainee (GET) in a multinational corporation. During my tenure there, my curiosity was piqued by the world of data sciences and analytics. I embarked on a journey to learn various analysis techniques, specializing in data transformation and visualization, utilizing tools such as MS Excel and PowerBI. Additionally, I honed my programming skills in SQL and Python.
